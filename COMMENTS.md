Installation
============

If you don't already have Node and Node Package Manager (NPM) installed, follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have Node and NPM installed, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing this file.

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once the installation finishes, you can run one of three commands.

Run the app, generating the filled out sclsp.csv file:

```
npm start
```

Run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

Run the code with hot reloading. This command requires having [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) installed globally:

```
npm restart
```
